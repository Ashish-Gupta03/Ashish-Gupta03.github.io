**Abstract:** We consider the task of generating explainable recommendations

with knowledge graphs in a large scale industrial e-commerce plat-
form. We propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach

for recommendation, which casts item recommendation problem

as a deterministic Markov Decision Process (MDP) over the knowl-
edge graph, wherein an agent starts from a user, and learns to

navigate to the potential items of interest. We hypothesize that the
path history can serve as a genuine explanation for why the item
is recommended to the user. Different from past work on RL on
knowledge graphs [9], we leverage sequential neural modeling of
user’s historic item history, and hierarchical softmax approach for
sampling paths in the knowledge graphs and propose Sequence
Aware Reinforced Learning over Knowledge Graphs (SeqReLG).

Experiments on large scale real world dataset highlights the ben-
efits offered by sequential modeling of user’s history and action

sampling techniques. We observe a significant gain in performance

when compared to state-of-the-art RL based approach. We addi-
tionally discuss and address implementation details for large scale

deployment of the proposed RL based solution.
