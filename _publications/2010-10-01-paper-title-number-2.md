**Abstract:** As an increasing number of consumers rely on on-line marketplaces to purchase goods from, demandprediction becomes an important problem for sup-pliers to inform their pricing and inventory manage-ment  decisions.   Business  volatility  and  the  com-plexity  of  factors  influence  demand,  which  makesit a harder quantity to predict.  In this paper, weconsider the case of an online classified marketplaceand propose a joint multi-modal neural model fordemand  prediction.   The  proposed  neural  modelincorporates  a  number  of  factors  including  prod-uct description information (title, description, im-ages),  contextual  information  (geography,  similarproducts) and historic interest to predict demand.Large-scale experiments on real-world data demon-strate superior performance over established base-lines.  Our experiments highlight the importance ofconsidering, quantifying and leveraging the textualcontent of products and image quality for enhanceddemand prediction. Finally, we quantify the impactof the different factors in predicting demand.
