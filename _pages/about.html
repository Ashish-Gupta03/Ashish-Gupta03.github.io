<div id="main1"><p align="justify"> I am currently working as Data Scientist in the Catalog team at Walmart Global Tech India. I work on using machine learning algorithms for enriching catalog in <a href="https://www.walmart.com/">walmart.com</a>. Mostly I work on attribute extraction from products, sequence labeling for products. Some of the important projects on which I've worked in Walmart include using limited labeled data for perform classification as well as sequence labeling task, using graphical models for recommendation. In tandem with product managers and my colleagues, I have worked on end-to-end implementation of attribute extraction systems at Walmart.</p>
<p align="justify"> Prior to my stint at Walmart, I got my Masters from IIIT Bangalore, and successfully completed my thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://research.google/people/106704/#:~:text=Manish%20Gupta%20is%20the%20Director,Xerox%20and%20IBM%20in%20India.">Manish Gupta</a>. I worked on Multi-task Question Answering extraction from Video transcripts.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>In recent times I've started focusing on graphical models and continue to work in deep learning. My goal is to teach myself enough in these areas and see how they intersect with the sequential/bandit world. You can find details of my <a href="https://Ashish-Gupta03.github.io/ashish-gupta-publications/">Publications</a> here.</b></p>

<!--<p align="justify"> I recently completed my masters thesis where, I developed a scalable distributed agent environment for swarm robotics experiments. The developed platform is a low-cost experimentation platform that can be used for any available swarm robot with minimal or no changes. Our platform helps the user to collect state data from the individual robots during the experiments. The platform provides the user with a glimpse of both the micro-->
<!--and macro world of swarm robots during a test. I am working on supporting heterogeneous agents onto the said-->
<!--platform. The platform takes inspiration from Cellular Automata with a collection of agents and patches located in-->
<!--parallel, one on top of the other. The platform also exploits the phenomenon of Stigmergy, which is a mechanism-->
<!--of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. </p> -->

<h2 align="left"> Research and other interests</h2>
<p align="justify"> My area of interest lies in Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval and Reinforcement Learning. I love using these techniques to solve industry related problems.</p>

<p align="justify"> Apart from my work, I enjoy travelling and learning about new cultures and languages. I really like to find interconnections and variation of languages of different places.
